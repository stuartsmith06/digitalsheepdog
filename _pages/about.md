My name is Stuart.  I currently work as a security architect for a large, fortune 100 company.  Some of my current areas of focus include Cloud Security, network security, cryptography, Internet of Things (IoT) security, application security, IAM, and a few others.

I have over 20 years of professional experience in the Information Security field working for the Department of Defense as a contractor in an information assurance and intelligence role and (for the majority of my time) for the private sector.  Prior to my career in cybersecurity, I spent 11 years in the United States Army, and served in duty stations around the world including combat operations in the Middle East.  I regularly speaks at security conferences and events around the country on a wide range of technology and cybersecurity topics.

I have a Bachelor’s in Management Information Systems, a Master’s in Cyber Security, and a Master’s in Theological Studies, all from Liberty University.  I have CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) and CISM (Certified Information Security Manager) certifications, and I'm also an AWS Solutions Architect.

When I'm not doing computer geek/cybersecurity stuff, I officiate men’s college and high school lacrosse, riding my Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and shooting both pistols and long-distance target shooting.  I also have a passion for Christian apologetics, and run another blog site <a href="https://www.apologeticsgeek.com" target="_blank">ApologeticsGeek.com</a>.
